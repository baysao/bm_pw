# Piwik RollUpReporting Plugin

## Description

Hi, this is Matt from [InnoCraft](http://www.innocraft.com/). The company of the makers of Piwik Analytics which is used by over 1 million websites and apps in over 150 countries.

At InnoCraft we run the Piwik project and community and we are responsible for many different websites. Our piwik.org website, the Piwik Marketplace, the Piwik Developer Zone, the Piwik Forum, 
and some more. When you run several websites, mobile apps, or sub-domains like we do, you want to understand the overall 
performance of your business while still being able to compare the performance of your individual websites and apps. Roll-Up Reporting is for you and will provide huge value.
 
<img src="https://www.innocraft.com/innocraft/rollUpReporting.png" style="width:320px;float:right;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:5px;" alt="Roll-Up Reporting">Roll-Up Reporting lets you aggregate data from multiple websites and apps into one single site. It lets you answer questions like 
"How many visits happened on all of my websites and apps?" and "Which campaigns contributed the most across several of my websites?" 
or "How do my various Brands overall compare with each other?"
When you have several shops (eg white-labels) it is very valuable to see how your ecommerce shops are performing overall. 
Or when you are a web agency and you are serving many customers and want to provide each customer with a single aggregate view of all their web properties.
Roll-Up Reporting lets you analyze this aggregated data in one site so easily. It saves you lots of time and helps you gain the insights you need instantly.

Lets say you have separate websites for different countries (your-business.com, your-business.fr, your-business.de, etc). They are separate 
sites in your Piwik but you might still want to see a combined report on all of them. 
Roll-Up Reporting gathers the data of these websites into one single site and allows you to see aggregated metrics and reports for those sites.
You can still access each website individually as you are used to, and the Roll-Up site will allow you to analyze the aggregated data.
 
Before we used Roll-Up Reporting, we couldn't get a detailed view of our overall web activity for our work on the Piwik project. 
Now that we have setup Roll-Up Reporting (which took less than five minutes), we know exactly the most popular content across all sub-domains and websites, 
we can easily optimise our marketing budget across all our web properties, and it's so much easier to monitor overall growth. 

<img src="https://www.innocraft.com/innocraft/our_promise.jpg" style="width:320px;float:right;margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Our promise to you">**Our promise** Roll-Up Reporting is hand-crafted by the makers of Piwik with top quality and integrates nicely into Piwik. 
We give you a 100% money back guarantee for 14 days so try it now and let us know how you do. We are happy to help you get started 
and are looking forward to hear how Roll-Up Reporting helps you.

**Important: This plugin requires Piwik 3**
